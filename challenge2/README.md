#Challenge #2
#Summary - We need to write code that will query the meta data of an instance within aws and provide a json formatted output. The choice of language #and implementation is up to you.
#Bonus Points - The code allows for a particular data key to be retrieved individually

Query the meta data of an instance within Azure VM and provide a json formatted output

1. Login to Azure VM (Linux) which you need to extract metadta info
2. Checkout source code from git repo
3. Make sure curl and jq installed in the VM
3. Execute script getMetadata.sh 

#getMetadata.sh will generate Azure VM metadata into JSON file vmMetadata.json 
#then extract details using jq
